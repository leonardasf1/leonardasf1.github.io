 <h2> Independence </h2>
<p>90 footer sloop Independence (Bowdoin B. Crowninshield, 1901) was Thomas W. Lawson's candidate for the 1901 America's Cup defence.</p>
<p>The Independence, a entrant for the 1901 America's Cup race. It was considered the fastest boat in the 1901 America's Cup, but turned out to be too fragile and was never in the race. The Cup was eventually won by the Columbia, one of only three boats to successfully defend the Cup.</p>
