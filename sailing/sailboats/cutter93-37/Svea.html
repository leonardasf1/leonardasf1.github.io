<p>The J-Class fleet gathering in Bermuda in 2017 will be joined by Svea J-S1 the latest J-Class.</p>
<p>The original lines for this Super-J were by Swede Tore Holm in 1937 but the yacht was never built. Holm’s drawings were eventually discovered by yachting historian John Lammerts van Beuren and now, this remarkable yacht, the longest modern J-Class at 143ft (43.6m), is taking shape at the Vitters yard in Zwartsluis for an American owner.</p>
<p>
Research using our Hoek’s velocity prediction programmes and computational fluid dynamic calculations show Svea to be particularly fast upwind and her aluminium construction with an emphasis on longitudinal stiffness will absorb high runner loads for optimal headstay tension.

Svea’s deck geometry is markedly different from other modern Js with two large working cockpits fore and aft of a relatively small companionway doghouse. There’s a vast amount of room for mainsheet, runner and headsail trimmers in the aft cockpit and the recessed pit forward of the house provides plenty of room and protection for the mid-deck and mast crew.

Another key feature is an over-size steering wheel, half of which is recessed below decks. The diameter allows the helmsman to position himself far enough outboard to get a good view of the headsail tell-tales, something which is difficult on other Js. A Southern Spars carbon rig package will be stepped and the hull colour for this giant J is to be a distinctive grey.

She has been luxuriously fitted out below and Dutchman Pieter Beeldsnijder, well known for his exceptional hand sketching, masterminded the below-decks looks with the Hoek office developing the accommodation drawings using our latest computer programmes. After the sad passing of Pieter Beeldsnijder, deVosdeVries design was brought in to complete interior hardware detailing, soft furnishings and support Vitters Shipyards during interior construction and fit out.
