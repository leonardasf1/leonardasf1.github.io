<p>J8 is an unbuilt 1935 Frank C Paine A design, and was launched Summer 2015. Lines plans were created by the Hoek Design office and they are also responsible for the complete optimisation of the yacht as well as her interior design. She is presently under construction at Holland Jachtbouw for delivery in early 2015 and will have a very special art-deco interior. Frank Paine had previously designed the yacht “Yankee”, which was built by Lawleys in 1930. ‘J8’ has been researched by the Hoek office, and found to be a good all round performer. She is the longest waterline J Class designed, with the highest keel aspect ratio, combined with the lowest wetted surface area. Frank Paine had already calculated in the 1930s that it was better to take a penalty on an increased waterline length in a trade off against sail area and displacement. She will carry a High Modulus carbon mast and boom, and fibre rigging.</p>
<p>The rebuild of J8 has commenced with the hull and deck being built at Freddie Bloemsma Shipyard and she is currently at Holland Jachtbouw where fitting out has commenced. She is expected to be launched in the Summer of 2015 and will be cruising for the remainder of the year.</p>
